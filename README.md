## Important Caveat
> üö® No strict checking is done for string values passed. For the compression/decompression to work properly please use
> comma seperated strings with no spaces inbetween the commas.

## Compression/Decompression

Compression/Decompression can be done through this UI via regular `.txt` file upload or by pasting a comma formatted string

### Sample Compression String - Comma Formatted

```javascript
myxa,myxophyta,myxopod,nab,nabbed,nabbing,nabit,nabk,nabob,nacarat,nacelle
```

### Sample Decompression String - Comma Formatted
